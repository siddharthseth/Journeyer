# Journeyer
Cal Hacks 2015

In response to the European Migrant Crisis, our project seeks to centralize all communications and pivotal information regarding shelter and water supply into one location-based Android mobile application. We enabled a host feature for those who wants to support the cause beyond donation. A host can ping their location with the information regarding whether they can offer shelter, food or water for the Journeyer. A Journeyer will be able to route from their location to their destination with refugee camp and host information nearest to the route.
